## UPDATE: 2024-01-11

The Interlock Front-end has been migrated to Vite instead of Webpack/Vue-CLI,
hence there will be performance improvements when running the dev-server and on the
final compiled version. YARN PKG is no longer used, use NPM instead.

  [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
