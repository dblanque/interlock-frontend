# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

* Why does the front-end use Vue 2 / Vuetify 2, isn't it EOL?
> Yes, Vue 2 is EOL but due to the scope of the project and the fact that
only one person is working on it actively, it was decided a functional product
is more important than boasting the newest framework and technologies.
It is also a robust and proven framework in spite of being EOL, and
validation is/should be done by the back-end anyways.

* Will it ever be upgraded/updated to Vue >= 3?
> If the project gains traction and support to justify the time investment,
it's within plans to either upgrade the current Front-end to Vue 3 with the
corresponding Vuetify version, or create a newer Front-end altogether in Vue 3
with the *Quasar Framework*.
